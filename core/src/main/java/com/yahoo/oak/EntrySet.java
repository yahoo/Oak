/* EntrySet keeps a set of entries. Entry is reference to key and value, both located off-heap.
 * EntrySet provides access, updates and manipulation on each entry, provided its index.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Due to limitation in amount of bits we use to represent Block ID the amount of memory
 * supported by ALL OAKs in one system is 128GB only!
 * TODO: this limitation will be removed once void memory manager fully is presented for keys
 *
 * Entry is a set of 6 (FIELDS) consecutive integers, part of "entries" int array. The definition
 * of each integer is explained below. Also bits of each integer are represented in a very special
 * way (also explained below). The bits manipulations are ReferenceCodec responsibility.
 * Please update with care.
