/* EntrySet keeps a set of entries. Entry is reference to key and value, both located off-heap.
 * EntrySet provides access, updates and manipulation on each entry, provided its index.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Due to limitation in amount of bits we use to represent Block ID the amount of memory
 * supported by ALL OAKs in one system is 128GB only!
 *
 * Entry is a set of 6 (FIELDS) consecutive integers, part of "entries" int array. The definition
 * of each integer is explained below. Also bits of each integer are represented in a very special
 * way (also explained below). This makes any changes made to this class very delicate. Please
 * update with care.
 *
 * Entries Array:
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0 | headNextIndex keeps entry index of the first ordered entry
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1 | NEXT  - entry index of the entry following the entry with entry index 1  |
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * 2 | KEY_REFERENCE          | these 2 integers together, represented as long  | entry with
 * --|                        | provide KEY_REFERENCE. Pay attention that       | entry index
 * 3 |                        | KEY_REFERENCE is different than VALUE_REFERENCE | 1
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * 4 | VALUE_REFERENCE        | these 2 integers together, represented as long  | entry that
 * --|                        | provide VALUE_REFERENCE. Pay attention that     | was allocated
 * 5 |                        | VALUE_REFERENCE is different than KEY_REFERENCE | first
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * 6 | VALUE_VERSION - the version of the value required for memory management  |
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 7 | NEXT  - entry index of the entry following the entry with entry index 2  |
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * 8 | KEY_REFERENCE          | these 2 integers together, represented as long  | entry with
 * --|                        | provide KEY_REFERENCE. Pay attention that       | entry index
