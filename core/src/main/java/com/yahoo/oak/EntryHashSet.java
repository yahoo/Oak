/**
 * EntryHashSet keeps a set of entries placed according to the key hash number modulo capacity.
 * Entry is reference to key and value, both located off-heap.
 * EntryHashSet provides access, updates and manipulation on each entry, provided its entry index.
 *
 * Entry of EntryHashSet is a set of 3 fields (consecutive longs), part of "entries" long array.
 * The definition of each long is explained below. Also bits of each long (references) are represented
 * in a very special way (also explained below). The bits manipulations are ReferenceCodec responsibility.
 * Please update with care.
 *
 * Entry's fields:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   0 | Key Reference: Reference encoding all info needed to access the key off-heap     |
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *   1 | Value Reference: Reference encoding all info needed to  access the key off-heap. |
 *     |                  The encoding of key and value can be different                  |
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *   2 | Hash: key hash, which might be different (bigger) than                           |
 *     |       entry index + update counter (increased every update)                      |
