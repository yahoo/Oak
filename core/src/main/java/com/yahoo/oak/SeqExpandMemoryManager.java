/**
 * A Sequential-Expanding Memory Manager doesn't impose any memory manager related actions upon any
 * access. A Sequential-Expanding reference is composed of 3 parameters:
 *
 * block ID (first), offset (second) and length (third)
 *
 * All these parameters may be squashed together into one long for easy representation.
 * Using different number of bits for each parameter may incur different limitations on their sizes.
 *
 * Number of bits used for BlockID + offset gives the size of the memory that can be referenced
 * with SeqExpandMemoryManager.
 *
 * If block size is 256MB = 2^28 --> takes 28 bits
 * Then BlockID+offset have 36 bits for their representation.
 * Total memory 64GB
 *
 *
 * The Sequential-Expanding reference codec encodes the reference of the Sequential-Expanding slices
 * into a single long primitive (64 bit).
 * For example, for the block size 256MB, we need 28 bits to encode the offset
 * and additional 28 bits to encode the length.
 * So, the remaining 8 bits can encode the block id, which will limit the maximal number of blocks to 256.
 * Thus, the key/value reference encoding when using this block size (256MB) will be as follows:
 *
 *    LSB                                       MSB
 *     |     offset     |     length     | block |
 *     |     28 bit     |     28 bit     | 8 bit |
 *      0             27 28            55 56   63
 *
 * From that, we can derive that the maximal number of 1K items that can be allocated is ~128 million (2^26).
 * Note: these limitations will change for different block sizes. */
